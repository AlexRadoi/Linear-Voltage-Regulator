# Linear-Voltage-Regulator

This is my third year project 
The specs for the regulator are :
- Supply voltage between: 30-33 V
- Programmable output voltage: 23-25V
- Output resistance: R<sub>o</sub>: 7.26Î©
- Maximum output current: 20mA
- Stability coefficient S: 136 
- PCB dimensions 40x40 mm

The regulator also has OverVoltage protection and short circuit protection at the output.

In the files attached to this repository there is a PDF file "P1_Calculus", containing all the calculus for the values of the components so you can costumize this regulator 
to fit your needs
